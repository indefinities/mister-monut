# 🍩 Mister Monut

My family opened up a bakery in Waltham, Massachusetts which sells Asian desserts such as kroffles and monuts. I wrote this website using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management and decided not to use a content management system instead. Don't ask me why 😅... Feel free to make contributions if you see something wrong 👀.
